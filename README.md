# SpawnerTiers
A NukkitX plugin that creates two new tiers of monster spawners.

Players can now upgrade their mob spawners using Nether Stars or EconomyAPI credits. The items or amount of credits to upgrade to each new tier can be changed in the config.yml file. Tier 2 doubles the rate of mob spawning, and Tier 3 triples the rate of mob spawning.

Command (Operator only): /spawner (player) [Tier 1-3] (mobType)

Note: Requires MobPlugin, and can use EconomyAPI.
